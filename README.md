# airpollutionproj
Summer Project on air Pollution and atmospheric parameter prediction using GRU neural network in TensorFlow.
This project is aimed at predicting air pollutant concentration and atomspheric parameter concentration in the future.
The code is divided into two parts batch.py and with test.py.
batch.py uploads data and divides it into batches while with test.py executes the neural network.
execute batch.py first and then test.py.
no2train is the training data nad no2 test is the testing data.
